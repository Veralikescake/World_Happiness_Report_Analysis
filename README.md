## About the Project

This is a self-initiated analysis project based on the World Happiness Report, an annual survey of the state of global happiness that ranks countries around the world by their happiness levels. The original dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness?resource=download).

This project looks into the the happiness levels by different continents and compares whether there's a statistical difference between them, as well as the top factors that contribute to such region differences.
